# Capstone Project - Program a Real Self-Driving Car

As the final project in the Self Driving Car Nanodegree, we need to program necessary ROS nodes and integrate them to a whole system. Then the car should be able to navigate itself along the test track and stop before stop lines if the red traffic light is detected. 

The project result was test both in the simulator and on the real road in California, USA.

In this project, we built up a team of 5 students from Udacity.

## Waypoints Updater


## Controller


## Traffic Light Detection
Because of the enorm szenario difference between simulator and real life situation, we decided to use two machine learning model to conduct the process respectively.
